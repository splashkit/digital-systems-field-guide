Now that we know what logic gates are and how they work, we can start combining them to build more powerful circuits. A single AND, OR, or NOT gate can make simple decisions, but real-world computing requires multiple gates working together to process and manipulate data. To perform complex operations, we need to combine multiple logic gates within a single circuit.

One of the simplest circuits that use multiple logic gates to perform a simple arithmetic operation is the half adder. This circuit is a fundamental step toward enablingcomputers to perform calculations. Next, we will explore it works.

Imagine you want to add two binary numbers, 0 + 1 or 1 + 1. A half adder is a simple circuit that uses an XOR gate and an AND gate to calculate the sum and carry-over, just like how carrying numbers when adding in decimal. This forms the foundation of arithmetic in computers. By combining multiple adders, we can create a full adder, which then scales up to an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)—a core component of the computer’s processor.

Read the page on [Half Adder Circuit – How it Works](https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/half-adder/) for more details on the half-adder circuit before proceeding to the next activity.

:::tip[Activity: Building a Half-Adder]

In this activity you will build a half adder circuit that adds two binary bits (A and B) to produce a Sum and Carry.

Truth Table:

```text
A  B  Sum  Carry
0  0   0     0
0  1   1     0
1  0   1     0
1  1   0     1
```

Note:

The half-adder combines **XOR gate** for Sum output and **AND gate** for Carry output

Building Steps:

1. Build XOR gate using combination of basic gates
2. Build AND gate for Carry
3. Connect inputs A and B via pushbuttons
4. Use LEDs to display Sum and Carry
5. Test all input combinations

Your half-adder circuit should look like this:

**Developing the circuit one step at a time will help improve your understanding. A tinkercad circuit diagram along with different sub-gates that make up a half-adder circuit is presented below.**

The half adder is built using a **XOR gate** and a **AND gate**. While a **XOR gate** can be built directly using minimum 6 transistors, we will instead break it down into the basic logic gates discussed earlier. An **XOR gate** can be built using a combination of **AND gate** and **OR gate**. In the half-adder, the **XOR gate** calculates the **sum**, while the additional **AND gate** determines the **carry**.

Below are a few scenarios and their expected outputs when you vary the signals. **Consider how these compare to the truth table provided above**

Fantastic! Now we know how computers add two binary numbers. But computers do much more than additions, they store and process data, make decisions, and execute instructions. To handle these tasks efficiently, logic circuits are grouped together on a single chip, known as an integrated circuit (IC). A single chip can contain millions or even billions of transistors working together, powering everything from simple memory storage to the advanced processors that run our modern devices.

There are ICs that specialize in performing specific tasks. For example, the 7846 (also known as 74LS86 or 74HC86) is a quadruple 2-input XOR gate integrated circuit. This means it contains **4 XOR gates** internally. This IC is commonly used in digital comparators (for comparing two binary numbers). Assuming each **XOR gate** is built from **6-10** transistors, this single IC contains around **24-40** transistors.

If a single logic gate can make a simple decision, how do millions of gates working together in a chip power complex applications like video games, AI, or even self-driving cars?
