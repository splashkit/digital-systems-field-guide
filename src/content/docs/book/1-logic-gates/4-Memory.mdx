## Storing the Digital World

So far, we have seen how logic gates can make simple decisions and how chips combine millions of these gates to process information. However, processing alone is not enough to perform the functions of modern digital systems. Computers also need a way to store and recall information. This is where memory comes in.

Computers face similar challenges as humans when performing tasks. Just as we we take notes to keep track of steps, computer must store instructions and data. They use memory circuits to temporarily hold data while working on a task (such as in Random Access Memory, RAM) and to retain important information even when powered off (such as in hard drives or portable storage).

Computer memory is built from the logic gates we have studied. In previous sections, we explored combinational logic, which determines outputs solely based on current inputs without remembering any past operations. However, for a computer to store information, it needs sequential logic.

## Sequential Logic, Clock and Flip-Flop

Sequential logic incorporates time-dependent elements that store past information, making it essential for memory and tracking a system state. It operates under the control of a clock signal, which dictates when values should be updated—similar to turning a page in a book to reveal the next step. This mechanism enables the computer to track its progress in a process, much like remembering your place while counting. 

Two fundamental types of memory circuits are latches and flip-flops. The key distinction between them lies in their response to input changes. A latch updates its output immediately as its input changes, always ready to respond. A flip-flop updates its output only at specific moments.

Another concept that is important in understanding memory is the clock. The lapse of time in computers is represented by a master clock. Flip-flops are useful in applications where changes need to be synchronised with a clock signal.

### Flip-flop

A flip-flop circuit (can be made of NAND or NOR gates) is a fundamental building block of memory and performs sequential logic. This circuit can store a single bit—either a 0 or a 1—until a new input changes its state.

Watch the following video to understand how a flip-flop circuit works.

## Registers and Other Memory Types

We have seen how flip-flops, built from simple logic gates and can store a single bit of data—either a 0 or a 1. However, a single bit is not enough to accomplish much on its own. To handle larger amounts of data, computers group multiple flip-flops together into registers.

A register is a small, high-speed memory unit that stores multiple bits (typically 8, 16, 32, or 64). Registers allow a processor to temporarily hold data that it is actively working with. For example, when you type a number into a calculator app, that number is first stored in a register before any calculations happen.

However, computers need to handle far more than just a few numbers at a time. This is where memory hierarchy comes into play. Registers are at the fastest and smallest level of this hierarchy, followed by cache memory, Random Access Memory (RAM), and long-term storage like Solid State Drives (SSDs) and hard drives which store data using more advanced memory technologies, such as flash memory and magnetic storage.

Watch the following video to learn about how registers and RAMs are built using a simple memory circuit that scales up to perform large operations.
