Before the complex circuits are build and tested, they are designed in a simulation environment. One simple platform used to simulate circuits is Tinkercad. You can access this simulation tool via [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/circuits) to explore how to create and test circuits.

**Check whether you can build a simple circuit in Tinkercad.**

:::note[Advanced Projects]
For additional challenge:

- Build a full adder
- Create a simple calculator
- Build a simple latch circuit (memory circuit) using transistors

:::note
Remember to always use current-limiting resistors with LEDs and base resistors for transistor protection.
