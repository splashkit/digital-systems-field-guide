title: Overview
---

This module explores the transition from manual switches to automated electronic controls, demonstrating how transistors and logic gates serve as the foundation of modern digital devices.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Explain how transistors automate switching
- Understand the basics of logic gates
- Interpret truth tables and logic operations
- Demonstrate how complex operations are built from simple gates
- Describe how integrated circuits combine multiple gates into functional chips

## Required Materials

For the basic transistor activities:

- Breadboard
- NPN transistors
- Resistors (1 kΩ for base, 220 Ω for LEDs where available)
- LEDs
- Push-button switches
- Power supply / battery
- Jumper wires

:::note
Colour-code your wires for easier circuit building:

- Red for power (VCC)
- Black for ground
- Different colours for inputs/outputs
