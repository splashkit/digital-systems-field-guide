## Binary to Hexadecimal

Working with the binary digits can become tiresome quickly, as you need more digits to represent values you are likely to work with. To help address this, we can go back to think about the use of number systems. While binary (base 2) is what we need within our digital circuits, when we need to work with binary data it may be useful to have a shorter form.

With binary, we are working with a base-2 system (only 2 different digits: 0 and 1). If we combined two of these digits, that would give us 4 different combinations, three digits would give us 8 different combinations, and four digits would give us 16 different combinations. Unfortunately none of these map nicely to decimal (base-10) which we are used to dealing with. So it is common in computing for binary values to be represented using base-16, known as hexadecimal.

Hexadecimal involves 16 different digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F. This gives us a new number system that can be used to represent any value. The good thing for us is that one hexadecimal digit maps to four binary digits.

| Hex | Binary | Decimal | | Hex | Binary | Decimal |
|-----|--------|---------|---|-----|--------|---------|
| `0` | `0000` | 0 | | `8` | `1000` | 8 |
| `1` | `0001` | 1 | | `9` | `1001` | 9 |
| `2` | `0010` | 2 | | `A` | `1010` | 10 |
| `3` | `0011` | 3 | | `B` | `1011` | 11 |
| `4` | `0100` | 4 | | `C` | `1100` | 12 |
| `5` | `0101` | 5 | | `D` | `1101` | 13 |
| `6` | `0110` | 6 | | `E` | `1110` | 14 |
| `7` | `0111` | 7 | | `F` | `1111` | 15 |

:::note

When working with binary data, you will often see it represented in hexadecimal rather than being fully expressed in binary digits. The key is to remember that each hexadecimal digit maps to four binary digits.

Two hexadecimal digits can then represent eight binary digits (a byte in computing) which has a range of 0 to 255 (256 values - `00` to `FF`).

**This representation of data is the most widely recognised and used in modern programming and technical documentation.**

Hexadecimals are also used in colour codes (in web design), memory addresses, and debugging programs. There are many articles on the web that can help you explore this topic. For example, you can read about [converting hexadecimal to binary](https://byjus.com/maths/convert-hexadecimal-to-binary/). There are also [hexadecimal to decimal](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html) converters that you can use to do the calculations for you.

## Representing Text

Now that we can represent numbers, by utilising the binary number system, how can we represent other kinds of data that we want to work with?

To explore this, let's have a look at how we can represent text.

## ASCII Encoding and Message Transmission

In order to represent text, we need a way of mapping a number to a character. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) assigns a unique number to each character.
- Letters (A-Z, a-z)
- Numbers (0-9)
- Special characters

For example, 
- 'A' = 65 in ASCII
- 'a' = 97 in ASCII
- ' ' (space) = 32 in ASCII

ASCII system is used in programming, and data storage. 


## UTF-8 code

ASCII is limited to 128 characters, which is not enough to represent all languages and special characters. This limitation was addressed by introducing a scheme, the most commonly used being Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8). UTF-8 uses variable byte lengths to represent different characters, with 1 byte being used to represent the most common characters (remember one byte is 8 bits). UTF-8 is used to represent thousands of characters from languages worldwide, including emojis 😂, mathematical symbols, and special characters. It is widely used in modern applications, such as web development and email communication.  

The [UTF-8 code page](https://www.charset.org/utf-8) provides a list of character mappings. For the moment, let's focus on a few basic characters: 0 to 9, A to Z, a to z, space, and a few others.

Here are a few mappings:

| Decimal | Character |
|---------|-----------|
| 48 | 0 |
| 49 | 1 |
| 57 | 9 |
| 65 | A |
| 66 | B |
| 90 | Z |
| 97 | a |
| 98 | b |
| 122 | z |

Then there are mappings like:

- 10 --> line feed (new line)
- 32 --> space
- 33 --> !

The UTF-8 code page also includes the hexadecimal values for characters, which can be useful when thinking about their binary representation.

For example, A has a UTF-8 Hexadecimal value of `41` which correcponds to `0100 0001` in binary.

Representing each character as a digit, you can create words by stringing a sequence of these characters together. So "Hi" would be represented by the character H (`48`) followed by the character i (`69`) resulting in the sequence `48 69`, or `0100 1000 0110 1001` in binary.

Sentences extend this pattern by adding spaces (`20`) and punctuation, like a full stop (`2E`), into the sequence.

## Numbers, colors, and others

To wrap up this section, let's explore other common ways of encoding information using numbers specifically binary, to store data in computers.

Any data you work with on a computer has been converted into binary values. While representing integer numbers is relatively straightforward, it is more complex to [represent negative values](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/representation-of-negative-binary-numbers). Real numbers are represented using [floating point numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-floating-point-representation/). In both cases, the binary digits within the values carry specific meaning.

This principle also applies to things like colors. A common color scheme uses a 32-bit value with 8 bits each for red, green, blue, and opacity (alpha) - known as [RBGA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_model). Images are then created by arranging sequences of these color values into a grid of picture elements (pixels).

As you can see, the goal is to use some systematic way to relate binary values to the information we are trying to capture. This can be achieved by mapping through a lookup table, as with text encoding, or by assigning different meanings to various parts of the binary value, and manipulate these by code that runs within the computer.

:::note
When converting binary to hexadecimal, remember that each hex digit represents 4 binary digits. For example: 10101 (binary) = 0x15 (hex)

Part 1: Discussion 

Are there any similarities between ASCII codes and UTF-8 codes? 

Part 2: ASCII in electronic  circuits 

Try displaying the word "Hi" in ASCII using the LEDs from the previous activity. Add more LEDs if needed:

1. Convert "H" (ASCII 72) to binary: 01001000
2. Convert "i" (ASCII 73) to binary: 01001001
3. Display each pattern using your LED setup


:::note
Remember to always verify your connections before applying power to the circuit. Double-check your resistor values to protect your LEDs from damage.
