This module explores the fundamental concepts of computer architecture, from basic components to practical applications.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Explain what a computer is and its purpose.
- Identify and describe the functions of basic computer components (hardware and software) using physical examples.
- Understand how the CPU interacts with memory and peripheral devices.
- Use a Raspberry Pi to demonstrate how computers process input, output, storage, and processing.
- Demonstrate how high-level programming translates into low-level hardware control.

In this module, we will break down the key parts of computer architecture, explore how a processor executes instructions, and write Python code on a Raspberry Pi to interact with hardwareâ€”bridging the gap between electronics and real-world computing.
