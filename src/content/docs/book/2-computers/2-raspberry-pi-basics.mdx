So far, we have explored the building blocks of computer architecture including memory, processors, and the components that make up a functioning computer. We have discussed how data moves through a system, how instructions are processed, and how a computer executes tasks. Though we understand these concepts now, the best way to grasp how a computer works is to interact with one at its core level—beyond the user interface.  

Yes, we are going to use Raspberry Pi. Unlike a traditional desktop or laptop, a Raspberry Pi is a compact, programmable computer that gives us direct access to the fundamental parts of a computing system. This credit card-sized computer packs all the essential components of a full-sized computer onto a single circuit board, making it a perfect learning tool and platform for creative projects.

### What Makes It Special?

Unlike traditional computers that spread their components across multiple boards and parts, the Raspberry Pi is what is known as a Single Board Computer (SBC). Imagine having your processor, memory, graphics, and input/output connections all integrated onto one compact board, that is what makes the Pi special. This all-in-one design not only keeps costs down (typically ranging from $35-75) but also makes it easier to understand how different computer components work together.

With the Raspberry Pi we can connect and control hardware components like LEDs, buttons, and sensors to see how input and output devices work, interact with memory and processor by writing programs that manipulate data, execute commands, and perform calculations and explore operating systems and networking to understand how a computer manages processes and connects to other devices.

### Some Applications

You can use the Raspberry Pi as,

* **Desktop Computer**: Perfect for basic computing tasks like web browsing, document editing, and email management. Its compact size makes it ideal for creating space-efficient workstations.

* **Learning Platform**: An excellent tool for learning programming languages, understanding electronics, and exploring computer science concepts. The hands-on nature of the Pi makes abstract computing concepts tangible.

* **Project Hub**: Serves as the brain for countless DIY projects, from home automation systems to weather stations. Its GPIO pins allow direct interaction with sensors, motors, and other electronic components.

* **Media Centre**: Can transform any TV into a smart entertainment system, capable of streaming media, running retro games, and managing digital content libraries.

### Components of Raspberry Pi

## Basic GPIO Projects

In our earlier activity, we used transistors to control LEDs, turning it on and off by controlling the flow of current. This demonstrated an essential principle of digital electronics where transistors form the foundation of computing by controlling electrical signals.

Now, we will use a Raspberry Pi to control the LED programmatically. This transition helps us understand how modern computers automate tasks using logic and code.

:::note[Hardware Setup]
Before starting:
1. Make sure your SD card is properly formatted or have a working operating system.
2. Connect display via HDMI.
3. Connect keyboard and mouse.
4. Power up using appropriate power supply.

If you want to refresh your memory on how to do the hardware setup, you can refer to [Build my Raspberry Pi in Programmer's Field Guide](https://programmers.guide/book/appendix/0-installation/2-2-pi-computer/)

### Project 1: LED Control
:::tip[Activity: LED Blinking]

This activity demonstrates how to control an LED using a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. 

##### Required Materials

* Raspberry Pi 4B
* Breadboard
* LED (any color)
* 220Ω resistor
* 2 jumper wires
* Python 3 installed on your Pi

##### Circuit Construction

1. Insert the LED into the breadboard
   * Long leg (anode) goes to GPIO pin 18 via jumper wire
   * Short leg (cathode) connects to ground

2. Connect the 220Ω resistor
   * One end to LED's cathode
   * Other end to ground rail

3. Connect jumper wires
   * GPIO 18 to LED's anode
   * Ground pin to breadboard's ground rail

Steps: Follow the steps given in the [blog post here](https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/27968772-turning-on-an-led-with-your-raspberry-pis-gpio-pins)

We will use GPIO 18 to connect the LED. Please check [the Raspberry Pi GPIO pinout] (https://raspberrytips.com/raspberry-pi-gpio-pinout/) before you build the circuit and the circuit should look like this:

Your circuit should look like this:

![Raspberry Pi LED connect](../images-common/rpi-led.png)

##### Run the following Python code:

```python
# Import required libraries
import RPi.GPIO as GPIO  # Library for GPIO control
import time  # Library for time-related functions

# Set GPIO mode to BCM numbering system
GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)

# Define the GPIO pin number for LED
LED_PIN = 18

# Setup GPIO pin as output
GPIO.setup(LED_PIN, GPIO.OUT)

try:
    while True:  # Infinite loop
        # Turn LED on by setting pin to HIGH
        GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.HIGH)
        # Wait for 1 second
        time.sleep(1)
        
        # Turn LED off by setting pin to LOW
        GPIO.output(LED_PIN, GPIO.LOW)
        # Wait for 1 second
        time.sleep(1)

except KeyboardInterrupt:
    # Clean up when program is stopped with Ctrl+C
    print("\nProgram stopped by user")
    GPIO.cleanup()  # Reset all GPIO pins
```

##### Running the Program (Watch the following video for basics on running a python code in RPi)

1. Save the code in a file (e.g., `led_blink.py`). You can copy the code in Thonny Python IDE which is pre-installed in Raspbian OS.
2. Open terminal on Raspberry Pi
3. Navigate to file location
4. Run with command: `python3 led_blink.py`
5. Press Ctrl+C to stop program

##### Discuss and Expand
* Why do we need only one resistor to prevent damage to the components? We used two resistors with LED in previous activites. Think about what changed.

Try modifying the code to:
* Change blink speed
* Create different blinking patterns
* Add multiple LEDs and use multiple GPIO pins to control them
