Now that we have explored transistors, logic gates, chips, and memory, it is time to step back and ask, how do all these individual components come together to create a working computer?

We started our digital systems discussions with transistors that control the flow of electricity in digital circuits. We explored how transistors are combined to form logic gates, which perform basic decision-making tasks. These gates then build circuits, like half-adders and adders, which become the foundation for computer chips.

We then looked at a way to store and process information using the fundamental building blocks we learned. We learned about how computer memory is formed from basic concepts of flip-flop circuits to RAM to hold the instructions and data needed for computation.

- How does a computer decide which instruction to execute?
- Where does software fit into all of this?
- How do different components—Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, and input/output devices—communicate seamlessly?

Next, we are going to find answers to above question by exploring the world of computer architecture, where we examine how a computer is structured, how it processes information, and how all the components we have learned about so far work together to create the powerful machines we use every day.

## What is a Computer?

A computer is a machine that processes information through four main operations:
1. Receiving input
2. Processing data
3. Storing information
4. Providing output

:::note[Think about It]
Computers come in different forms that are not just laptops and desktops. Many everyday devices are actually computers including smart home devices and kitchen appliances.

 Watch the following video to understand how all these operations work together.

## Processor/ CPU 

In the previous chapter we have explored how computers store information in memory, from simple bits to complex storage systems. However, storing data is just one piece of the puzzle. How does a computer actually use this information to make decisions, run programs, and perform calculations?

This is where the processing units come in. Think of a computer like a busy kitchen. The memory acts as a pantry, storing ingredients (data). Maybe RAM is the mixing where you have ingredient for easy access.  However, having a full pantry does not cook a meal. You need a chef to take those ingredients, follow a recipe, do all the decision makings, and prepare the dish. In a computer, this “chef” is the processor, also known as the Central Processing Unit (CPU).

First, watch the following video to understand how processors execute instructions with fetche-decode-execute cycle. This is the cycle that the processor follows from boot-up until the shutdown to process the instructions.

### Multi-core

A core is an individual processing unit within a CPU that carries out the tasks. Modern CPUs has multiple cores, the system treats each core as an independent processor, allowing it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously.

Early computers could only perform one task at a time because they were built with single-core processors. However, with advancements in technology, multi-core CPUs were introduced. Multi-core processors significantly improve the processing efficiency. 


### GPU

In modern computing, the CPU does not work alone. Just like a restaurant kitchen might have different chefs for grilling, baking, and plating food, computers use specialised processing units to handle different tasks efficiently. The Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) speeds up images and videos, while other co-processors handle tasks like artificial intelligence or cryptography.

Watch the following video for more details on GPU and what are the differences between a CPU and a GPU.
