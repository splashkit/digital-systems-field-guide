# Introduction to Network Security

We have learned about the importance of networks and how variety of network protocols and devices forms Internet that we use today. However, those protocols also bring vulnerabilities. As our reliance on digital communication and online services continues to grow, securing computer networks has become more critical than ever. Network security refers to the strategies, technologies, and practices designed to protect data and systems as they are transmitted across or accessed through networks. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information by preventing unauthorised access, misuse, or disruption.

Whether it is protecting personal data on a home WiFi network or securing sensitive information in a large organisation's infrastructure, network security plays a vital role in keeping our digital world safe. This field covers a wide range of areas including firewalls, encryption, authentication protocols, intrusion detection, and more. In this final section, we will briefly look at the fundamentals of network security.

## Why Network Security Matters

Network security is crucial because:

1. **Data Protection**: Sensitive information should remain private
2. **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of communicating parties
3. **Integrity**: Ensuring data has not been tampered with
4. **Availability**: Keeping systems operational despite attack attempts
5. **Compliance**: Meeting legal and regulatory requirements

:::note[Think about It: Personal Data in Transit]
Consider what sensitive information you transmit over networks daily:
- Passwords and login credentials
- Financial information
- Personal messages
- Health information
- Location data

Without proper security, this information could be intercepted or manipulated by attackers.

## Common Network Security Threats

Understanding potential threats is the first step in protection:

### 1. Eavesdropping (Sniffing)

**What it is**: Intercepting and reading network traffic not intended for you.

**How it works**: Using tools like Wireshark on unsecured networks to capture sensitive data.

**Example**: Capturing login credentials on an open Wi-Fi network.


### 2. Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

**What it is**: Inserting oneself between two communicating parties, intercepting and potentially altering traffic.

**How it works**: Redirecting traffic through an attacker's system by manipulating DNS, ARP, or routing.

**Example**: Fake Wi-Fi hotspots that masquerade as legitimate networks.


### 3. Denial of Service (DoS)

**What it is**: Overwhelming a system to make it unavailable to legitimate users.

**How it works**: Flooding a target with excessive traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities. Example: TCP SYN Flood.

**Example**: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks using botnets.

### 4. Spoofing

**What it is**: Impersonating another device or user.

**How it works**: Falsifying data to disguise one's identity.

**Types**:
- IP spoofing (forging source IP address)
- MAC spoofing (forging hardware address)
- Email spoofing (forging sender information)

### 5. Packet Injection

**What it is**: Inserting malicious packets into an established communication stream.

**How it works**: Exploiting weaknesses in protocols to insert unauthorised commands or data.

**Example**: Injecting malicious SQL commands into unprotected web traffic.

 Phishing is a tactic used by cybercriminals to deceive you into revealing personal information. This is more related to data security and privacy. It is important to learn how to recognise and guard against suspicious emails, text messages, and social media content designed to trick you.

 Wireshark can be used to detect anomalies in the network involves identifying unusual or suspicious patterns in network traffic that could indicate issues such as security threats, performance problems, or misconfigurations.

## Basic Security Measures

Let's explore fundamental security techniques that address these threats:

### Encryption

Encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into encoded data (ciphertext) that can only be read with the proper key.

**Types of Encryption:**

1. **Symmetric Encryption**:
   - Uses the same key for encryption and decryption
   - Faster but requires secure key exchange
   - Examples: AES, 3DES

2. **Asymmetric Encryption**:
   - Uses public-private key pairs
   - Anyone can encrypt with the public key, but only the private key holder can decrypt
   - Slower but solves key distribution problem
   - Examples: RSA, ECC

3. **Hybrid Approaches**:
   - Use asymmetric encryption to exchange symmetric keys
   - Then use faster symmetric encryption for bulk data
   - How most secure connections work today


### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

TLS (formerly SSL) secures communication at the transport layer, most commonly seen in HTTPS.

**How TLS Works:**

1. **Handshake**:
   - Client and server agree on protocol version and cipher suite
   - Server authenticates with a certificate
   - Session keys are established

2. **Data Transfer**:
   - All data is encrypted with the session keys
   - Message Authentication Codes (MACs) ensure integrity
   - Sequence numbers prevent replay attacks

**In Wireshark:**
- TLS traffic shows the handshake process
- The actual content is encrypted and unreadable
- Look for certificate information and cipher suites


### Authentication and Authorisation

Security also involves verifying identity and access rights:

1. **Authentication Methods**:
   - Passwords and passphrases
   - Digital certificates
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - Biometrics

2. **Authorisation Frameworks**:
   - Access Control Lists (ACLs)
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
   - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)

### Firewalls, IPS (Intrusion Prevention System), and IDS (Intrusion Detection System)

Physical and virtual network protection includes:

1. **Firewalls**:
   - Filter traffic based on rules
   - Types: packet filtering, stateful inspection, application-level
   - Can be hardware devices or software

2. **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems**:
   - Monitor for suspicious patterns
   - IDS: Detects and alerts
   - IPS: Detects and actively blocks

### Developing Cybersecurity Threat Models

Developing cybersecurity threat models involves systematically identifying and evaluating potential security threats to a system, application, or network. This section provides a high-level guide on how to develop an effective cybersecurity threat model. 

1. Define the system or scope :
Clearly outline what you are protecting such an application, network infrastructure, or a service and identify components, boundaries, and users.

2. Identify assets: 
Determine what is valuable and worth protecting such as user data, intellectual property, or credentials and understand where sensitive data resides and flows.

3. Understand the architecture
Create diagrams of your system, including data flows, user interactions, third-party services, and trust boundaries.

4. Identify threats

Use a structured method like STRIDE to identify different types of threats:
- Spoofing identity
- Tampering with data
- Repudiation
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Elevation of privilege

5. Assess risks
Prioritise threats based on likelihood and impact and different tools can be used for this.

6. Identify mitigations
For each threat, consider existing controls and possible mitigations and take users, process, and mitigation technology into account

7. Document and review
Record the identified threats, risk ratings, and mitigations and update regularly as the system evolves.

Consider scenario where your school has a smart classroom setup with a smartboard connected to the school network where
a teacherâ€™s laptop is used to control the smartboard. Students have access to WiFi, online learning apps, and cloud storage. There is a security camera inside the classroom.

Can you develop a basic threat model to protect this environment?
