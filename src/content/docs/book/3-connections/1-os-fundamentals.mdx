### What is an Operating System?

An operating system (OS) is software that manages computer hardware and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users, applications, and hardware.

#### Key Functions of an Operating System:

1. **Process Management**: Controls the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes
2. **Memory Management**: Allocates and deallocates memory space as needed
3. **File System Management**: Organizes and controls access to files
4. **Device Management**: Controls input/output devices and peripherals
5. **User Interface**: Provides ways for users to interact with the computer
6. **Security**: Controls access to system resources

### Operating Systems in Our Devices

| Device               | Operating System              | Key Characteristics           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Raspberry Pi 4B      | Raspberry Pi OS (Linux-based) | Full multitasking OS with GUI |
| Raspberry Pi Pico 2W | No OS (bare metal)            | Direct hardware execution     |
| Smartphone           | Android/iOS                   | Mobile-optimized OS           |
| Laptop/Desktop       | Windows/macOS/Linux           | General purpose OS            |
| Smart Watch          | watchOS/Wear OS               | Resource-constrained OS       |

### Exploring Raspberry Pi OS

Raspberry Pi OS is a Linux-based operating system optimized for the Raspberry Pi hardware. Let's explore some essential concepts:

#### The Linux File System Hierarchy

```
/
├── bin/    # Essential command binaries
├── boot/   # Boot loader files
├── dev/    # Device files
├── etc/    # System configuration files
├── home/   # User home directories
├── lib/    # Essential shared libraries
├── media/  # Mount points for removable media
├── mnt/    # Temporary mount points
├── opt/    # Optional application software
├── proc/   # Virtual filesystem for process info
├── root/   # Home directory for root user
├── sbin/   # System binaries
├── sys/    # Virtual filesystem for system info
├── tmp/    # Temporary files
├── usr/    # User utilities and applications
└── var/    # Variable files (logs, etc.)
```

#### Process Management

In Linux, processes are managed using commands like:

- `ps` - List running processes
- `top` or `htop` - Monitor system performance and processes
- `kill` - Terminate a process

:::tip[Activity: Exploring Processes]

1. Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi 4B
2. Run `ps aux` to see all running processes
3. Now run `htop` (install with `sudo apt install htop` if needed)
4. Observe the processes, CPU usage, and memory usage
5. Start a new application (like Chromium browser)
6. Observe how the process list changes
7. Exit htop with `q`

Questions to consider:

- What processes consume the most resources?
- What happens when you start multiple applications?
- How does the OS distribute CPU time among processes?

#### Hardware Interaction through the OS

Operating systems provide interfaces to hardware through:

- **Device Drivers**: Software that enables the OS to communicate with hardware
- **System Calls**: Interfaces that allow programs to request OS services
- **File System**: Provides consistent access to storage devices

On Raspberry Pi OS, hardware GPIO pins are accessible through the file system:

```bash
# Access GPIO via the file system
cd /sys/class/gpio
echo 17 > export       # Create a file interface for GPIO 17
cd gpio17
echo out > direction   # Set GPIO 17 as output
echo 1 > value         # Set GPIO 17 high
echo 0 > value         # Set GPIO 17 low
```

:::note[OS Abstraction]
Notice how the operating system provides abstractions:

- Processes appear as files in the `/proc` directory
- Hardware appears as files in the `/sys` directory
- Physical devices appear as files in the `/dev` directory

This "everything is a file" approach is a fundamental design philosophy in Unix/Linux systems.
