Now that we've explored the basics of connecting digital systems, let's touch on some more advanced concepts that are important in modern computing systems.

### Network Communication

Modern digital systems frequently communicate over networks. Here are some key concepts:

#### The OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model divides network communication into seven layers:

1. **Physical Layer**: Hardware transmission (cables, radio signals)
2. **Data Link Layer**: Node-to-node connections and error detection
3. **Network Layer**: Routing and addressing (IP)
4. **Transport Layer**: End-to-end connections (TCP, UDP)
5. **Session Layer**: Session establishment and management
6. **Presentation Layer**: Data translation and encryption
7. **Application Layer**: Application-specific protocols (HTTP, FTP)

Our Raspberry Pi and Pico 2W are communicating at multiple layers:

- Physical/Data Link: WiFi or Bluetooth radio signals
- Network/Transport: IP and TCP/UDP protocols
- Application: Our custom protocols or HTTP

#### Internet Protocols

The most common internet protocols include:

- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Addressing and routing packets
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Reliable, ordered data delivery
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Fast, connectionless communication
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**: Web communication
- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: Lightweight IoT messaging

:::note[MQTT for IoT]
MQTT is particularly important for IoT projects. It's a lightweight publish/subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency networks. The Pico 2W can use MQTT to communicate with servers or cloud services with minimal overhead.

### Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)

While the Raspberry Pi 4B runs a full Linux operating system and the Pico 2W typically runs bare-metal code, there's a middle ground: Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS).

An RTOS is designed to:

- Process data as it comes in, with minimal delay
- Provide predictable timing for operations
- Efficiently manage resources on constrained devices

Popular RTOS options for microcontrollers include:

- **FreeRTOS**: Open-source RTOS that can run on the Pico 2W
- **Zephyr**: Scalable RTOS for connected devices
- **RIOT**: IoT-focused RTOS

Using an RTOS on the Pico 2W would allow more complex applications with:

- Task scheduling
- Resource management
- Timing guarantees

### Buses and Peripheral Communication

Modern computers and embedded systems use various buses to connect internal components and peripherals:

#### Internal Computer Buses

- **Memory Bus**: Connects CPU to RAM
- **PCI Express (PCIe)**: High-speed computer expansion bus
- **System Bus**: Connects major computer components

#### External/Peripheral Buses

- **USB (Universal Serial Bus)**: Connects external devices
- **HDMI**: Audio/video transmission
- **SATA**: Storage device connection

The Raspberry Pi 4B exposes several of these buses, allowing it to connect to displays, storage, and other peripherals.
