title: Wireless Connections Between Raspberry Pi and Pico 2W
---

import { YouTube } from 'astro-embed';

Now that we understand the fundamentals of communication protocols, let's explore how to establish wireless connections between our Raspberry Pi 4B and Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. Wireless communication allows for flexible device placement and eliminates the need for physical cables, enabling more dynamic project implementations and applications. Unlike UART connections that require physical wires, Wi-Fi allows for flexible device placement and enables more dynamic project implementations.

In this section, we will focus on two primary wireless connectivity methods, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. Each offers distinct advantages and is suited for different applications.

:::note[Think about It: Choosing the Right Wireless Protocol]

- What factors would influence your choice between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for a project?
- How do range, power consumption, and data rate requirements affect this decision?
- What security considerations should you keep in mind when implementing wireless communication?
- In what scenarios do you need to use both protocols in the same project?

## Wireless Connection Activity

In this activity we are going to send and receive data between Raspberry Pi 4B and Raspberry Pi Pico 2W.

### Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4B
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W (with built-in Wi-Fi)
- USB cable (for initial programming)
- Thonny IDE with MicroPython installed

### Method 1: Wi-Fi Communication

Wi-Fi provides high-bandwidth network connectivity and is perfect for applications requiring Internet access or data transfer across longer distances. The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W comes with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities that we can leverage with MicroPython.

:::note[Remember]

Always connect the Raspberry Pi 4B with Pico 2W using Thonny and install the needed MicroPython so that you can develop the code on the Pico 2W. The following code should be executed on the Pico 2W unless explicitly specified to be executed on the Raspberry Pi.

### Step 1: Finding Available Wi-Fi Networks

Before connecting to a Wi-Fi network, you should scan for available networks in your area. This helps identify the SSID (network name) to connect to.

```python
# wifi-find.py

import network

# Init Wi-Fi interface
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)

# Scan for Wi-Fi networks
networks = wlan.scan()

# Print Wi-Fi networks
print("Available WiFi Networks:")
for network_info in networks:
    print(network_info)
```

#### Understanding Network Information

When you run the scan, each network is represented as a tuple containing:

- SSID (network name)
- BSSID (access point MAC address)
- Channel number
- RSSI (signal strength)
- Security type
- Hidden network flag

This information helps you identify the strongest networks and their security types.

_Wi-Fi Network Scan Output_

### Step 2: Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network

Once you have identified the network you want to connect to, you can establish a connection using its SSID and password:

```python
# wifi-connect.py

import network
from time import sleep

# Wi-Fi credentials
ssid = 'YOUR_NETWORK_NAME'
password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

# Init Wi-Fi Interface
wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)

# Connect to your network
wlan.connect(ssid, password)

# Wait for Wi-Fi connection
connection_timeout = 10
while connection_timeout > 0:
    if wlan.status() >= 3:
        break
    connection_timeout -= 1
    print('Waiting for Wi-Fi connection...')
    sleep(1)

# Check if connection is successful
if wlan.status() != 3:
    raise RuntimeError('Failed to establish a network connection')
else:
    print('Connection successful!')
    network_info = wlan.ifconfig()
    print('IP address:', network_info[0])
```

After running this code, your Pico 2W should be connected to the specified Wi-Fi network. Make note of the IP address that is printed, you will need this for communication between devices.

![Wi-Fi Connection Success](./images/wifi/wifi-connect.png)
_Wi-Fi Connection Success_

Your Pico 2W is now connected to WiFi and can send and receive data wirelessly now. Connect you RPi to the same WiFi and now we can start communicating between the devices.

:::tip[Activity: Connect your Pico to the WiFi]
Connect your Pico to the WiFi network that your RPi is connected.

1. make note of IP addresses assigned to each device (take screenshots/ photos).
Tip: You can use "ip a" command in the terminal to find the ip address assigned to RPi.

1. Do you see any similarity between the IP addresses?

:::tip[Activity: Synchronized LED Blinking]

In this activity, you'll create a wireless system where LEDs on both your Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W blink in perfect synchronization. This demonstrates how wireless protocols can coordinate actions across different devices.

#### Learning Objectives:
- Implement wireless communication between Raspberry Pi and Pico
- Understand timing and synchronization challenges
- Create a visual demonstration of synchronized systems

#### What You'll Need:
- Raspberry Pi 4B with Raspberry Pi OS
- Raspberry Pi Pico 2W with MicroPython
- LED connected to GPIO pin 17 on Raspberry Pi
- Onboard LED on Pico 2W
- Both devices connected to the same WiFi network

This method uses a basic countdown timer to synchronize the LEDs:

#### Step 1: Set Up the Raspberry Pi Server

Create a file named `led_sync_server.py` on your Raspberry Pi:

```python
import socket
import time
from gpiozero import LED

# Set up the LED
led = LED(17)  # Change to your GPIO pin if different

# Create a socket server
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
server_socket.bind(('0.0.0.0', 8000))
server_socket.listen(1)

print("Server started, waiting for connection...")

# Accept connection from Pico
client_socket, address = server_socket.accept()
print(f"Connection from {address} established")

try:
    # Send synchronization message with 5-second countdown
    sync_time = time.time() + 5
    client_socket.send(f"{sync_time}".encode())
    print(f"Synchronization time sent: {sync_time}")
    
    # Wait until it's time to start blinking
    delay = sync_time - time.time()
    if delay > 0:
        print(f"Waiting {delay:.2f} seconds to synchronize...")
        time.sleep(delay)
    
    # Start synchronized blinking
    print("Starting synchronized blinking!")
    while True:
        led.on()
        time.sleep(1)
        led.off()
        time.sleep(1)
        
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    print("Stopping...")
finally:
    client_socket.close()
    server_socket.close()
    led.off()
```

#### Step 2: Set Up the Pico W Client

Create a file named `led_sync_client.py` on your Pico W. Make sure you update the `RASPBERRY_PI_IP_ADDRESS`, `YOUR_WIFI_SSID` and `YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD` fields in the code below:

```python
import socket
import time
import network
from machine import Pin

# Connect to WiFi
def connect_to_wifi(ssid, password):
    wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
    wlan.active(True)
    wlan.connect(ssid, password)
    
    # Wait for connection
    max_wait = 10
    while max_wait > 0:
        if wlan.status() < 0 or wlan.status() >= 3:
            break
        max_wait -= 1
        print('Waiting for connection...')
        time.sleep(1)
    
    if wlan.status() != 3:
        raise RuntimeError('Network connection failed')
    else:
        print('Connected')
        status = wlan.ifconfig()
        print('IP:', status[0])
    
    return wlan

# WiFi credentials - replace with your network details
ssid = 'YOUR_WIFI_SSID'
password = 'YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD'

# Connect to WiFi
wlan = connect_to_wifi(ssid, password)

# Set up the LED
led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)

# Set up the client socket
client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_address = ('RASPBERRY_PI_IP_ADDRESS', 8000)  # Replace with your Raspberry Pi's IP
print(f"Connecting to {server_address}...")
client_socket.connect(server_address)
print("Connected to server")

try:
    # Receive synchronization time from server
    sync_data = client_socket.recv(1024).decode()
    sync_time = float(sync_data)
    print(f"Received sync time: {sync_time}")
    
    # Wait until it's time to start blinking
    current_time = time.time()
    delay = sync_time - current_time
    if delay > 0:
        print(f"Waiting {delay:.2f} seconds to synchronize...")
        time.sleep(delay)
    
    # Start synchronized blinking
    print("Starting synchronized blinking!")
    while True:
        led.value(1)  # LED on
        time.sleep(1)
        led.value(0)  # LED off
        time.sleep(1)
        
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
finally:
    client_socket.close()
    led.value(0)
```

#### Step 3: Run the Activity

1. Replace the WiFi credentials and Raspberry Pi IP address in the Pico code
2. Run the server script on your Raspberry Pi first:
   ```
   python3 led_sync_server.py
   ```
3. Run the client script on your Pico W (using Thonny or your preferred method)
4. Watch as both LEDs begin blinking in synchronization!

The LEDs should sync and blink one after the other as shown in the video below:

## Method 2: Bluetooth Communication

The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W also has Bluetooth capabilities, allowing for direct device-to-device communication without needing a network infrastructure. While Wi-Fi is suitable for longer range and higher bandwidth applications, Bluetooth offers better power efficiency and direct device-to-device connectivity without requiring a network infrastructure. The Raspberry Pi Pico 2W supports Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), which is suitable for lower-power applications.

### Understanding BLE on Pico 2W

Bluetooth Low Energy works on a peripheral/central device model:

- **Peripheral**: A device that advertises its presence and provides data or services (in our case the `Pico 2W`)
- **Central**: A device that scans for and connects to peripherals (in our case `Raspberry Pi 4B`)

Communication happens through defined characteristics that can be read from or written to.

### Setting Up BLE on Pico 2W

### Step 1: Preparing the Required Files for Pico 2W

For Bluetooth communication, we need three Python files on the Pico 2W. Make sure to store these files on the Pico 2W and not the Rpi:

1. **ble_advertising.py** - Helper module for generating BLE advertising information, i.e, payloads
2. **ble_simple_peripheral.py** - Module for implementing a BLE peripheral device
3. **main.py** - Our main code that uses the above modules to communicate

Let's start by creating these files one by one.

#### File 1: ble_advertising.py

```python
# ble_advertising.py
# Helpers for generating BLE advertising payloads.

from micropython import const
import struct
import bluetooth

# Advertising payloads are repeated packets of the following form:
#   1 byte data length (N + 1)
#   1 byte type (see constants below)
#   N bytes type-specific data

_ADV_TYPE_FLAGS = const(0x01)
_ADV_TYPE_NAME = const(0x09)

_ADV_TYPE_UUID16_MORE = const(0x2)
_ADV_TYPE_UUID32_MORE = const(0x4)
_ADV_TYPE_UUID128_MORE = const(0x6)
_ADV_TYPE_APPEARANCE = const(0x19)

# Generate a payload to be passed to gap_advertise(adv_data=...).
def advertising_payload(limited_disc=False, br_edr=False, name=None, services=None, appearance=0):
    payload = bytearray()

    def _append(adv_type, value):
        nonlocal payload
        payload += struct.pack("BB", len(value) + 1, adv_type) + value

    _append(
        _ADV_TYPE_FLAGS,
        struct.pack("B", (0x01 if limited_disc else 0x02) + (0x18 if br_edr else 0x04)),
    )

    if name:
        _append(_ADV_TYPE_NAME, name)

    if services:
        for uuid in services:
            b = bytes(uuid)
            if len(b) == 2:
                _append(_ADV_TYPE_UUID16_COMPLETE, b)
            elif len(b) == 4:
                _append(_ADV_TYPE_UUID32_COMPLETE, b)
            elif len(b) == 16:
                _append(_ADV_TYPE_UUID128_COMPLETE, b)

    # See org.bluetooth.characteristic.gap.appearance.xml
    if appearance:
        _append(_ADV_TYPE_APPEARANCE, struct.pack("<h", appearance))

    return payload


def decode_field(payload, adv_type):
    i = 0
    result = []
    while i + 1 < len(payload):
        if payload[i + 1] == adv_type:
            result.append(payload[i + 2 : i + payload[i] + 1])
        i += 1 + payload[i]
    return result


def decode_name(payload):
    n = decode_field(payload, _ADV_TYPE_NAME)
    return str(n[0], "utf-8") if n else ""


def decode_services(payload):
    services = []
    for u in decode_field(payload, _ADV_TYPE_UUID16_COMPLETE):
        services.append(bluetooth.UUID(struct.unpack("<h", u)[0]))
    for u in decode_field(payload, _ADV_TYPE_UUID32_COMPLETE):
        services.append(bluetooth.UUID(struct.unpack("<d", u)[0]))
    for u in decode_field(payload, _ADV_TYPE_UUID128_COMPLETE):
        services.append(bluetooth.UUID(u))
    return services

#### File 3: main.py (Pico 2W LED Control)

```python
# main.py

from machine import Pin
import bluetooth
from ble_simple_peripheral import BLESimplePeripheral

# Create a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) object
ble = bluetooth.BLE()

# Create an instance of the BLESimplePeripheral class with the BLE object
sp = BLESimplePeripheral(ble)

# Create a Pin object for the onboard LED, configure it as an output
led = Pin("LED", Pin.OUT)

# Initialize the LED state to 0 (off)
led_state = 0

# Define a callback function to handle received data
def on_rx(data):
    print("Data received: ", data)  # Print the received data
    global led_state  # Access the global variable led_state
    if data == b'o':  # Check if the received data is "o"
        led.value(not led_state)  # Toggle the LED state (on/off)
        led_state = 1 - led_state  # Update the LED state

# Start an infinite loop
while True:
    if sp.is_connected():  # Check if a BLE connection is established
        sp.on_write(on_rx)  # Set the callback function for data reception
```

### Step 2: Flashing the Files to Pico 2W

Follow these steps to upload the files to your Pico 2W using Thonny:

1. Connect your Pico 2W to your computer via USB
2. Open Thonny IDE
3. Click on the bottom right corner where it says "Python" and select "MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)"
4. Create three new files and copy the code for each file provided above
5. Save each file to the Pico by selecting "Save as..." and choosing "Raspberry Pi Pico" as the location
   - Save the first file as `ble_advertising.py`
   - Save the second file as `ble_simple_peripheral.py`
   - Save the third file as `main.py` (this will run automatically on boot)
6. Disconnect the Pico from your computer (if needed)

![BLE Pico store on pico](./images/bluetooth/storing-on-pico.png)
_BLE save file in Pico_

![BLE Pico advertise](./images/bluetooth/start-advertise.png)
_BLE Pico advertise_

Now your Pico 2W is set up as a BLE peripheral device that will toggle its onboard LED when it receives the character 'o' from a connected BLE central device.

### Step 3: Setting Up the Raspberry Pi 4B as a BLE Client

Now we will create a Python script for the Raspberry Pi 4B to connect to the Pico 2W and send commands to control its LED. This script uses the `bluepy` library, which we need to install first.

#### Installing Dependencies on Raspberry Pi 4B

Open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi 4B and run the following commands. The installation may take several minutes and let it complete the installation successfully:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip libglib2.0-dev
sudo pip3 install bluepy --break-system-packages
```

#### Python Script for Raspberry Pi 4B

Create a new file named `ble_client.py` on your Raspberry Pi 4B:

```python

### Step 4: Running the BLE Client on Raspberry Pi 4B

1. Save the code above to a file named `ble_client.py` on your Raspberry Pi 4B.

2. Run the script in scan mode to find your Pico 2W:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 ble_client.py --scan
   ```

    ![BLE Scan](./images/bluetooth/ble-scan-client.png)
    _BLE Scan_

3. You can run the client code directly to enable the interactive mode:

   ```bash
   sudo python3 ble_client.py
   ```

   This will allow you to type commands (like 't' to toggle the LED).

    ![BLE Interactive](./images/bluetooth/ble-connect-client.png)
   _BLE Interactive_

4. Pressing `t` in the interactive mode will send the data via the bluetooth to Pico to toggle the LED light. See the console on Thonny to see the received data.

### Understanding the Communication

1. The Pico 2W acts as a peripheral device that advertises its presence.
2. The Raspberry Pi 4B acts as a central device that scans for and connects to the Pico.
3. The communication uses the Nordic UART Service (NUS), which emulates a UART connection over BLE.
4. When the Raspberry Pi sends the character 'o', the Pico toggles its onboard LED.
5. The communication is bidirectional, so the Pico can also send data back to the Raspberry Pi.

:::tip[Activity: Connect your Pico and RPi via  BLE]

Follow the above instructions and set up Bluetooth communication between your Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W. This allows wireless control and data exchange between these devices without requiring a wired connection.

Ensure you collect and document all necessary evidence to demonstrate completion of the activity.

{/*
The Nordic UART Service provides a simple but effective way to send commands and data in both directions, making it ideal for a wide range of IoT projects*/}
