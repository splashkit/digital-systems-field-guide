title: Communication Protocols

For digital systems to work together, they need standardized ways to communicate. These standardized methods are called **communication protocols**.

### Serial vs. Parallel Communication

| Serial Communication                          | Parallel Communication             |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Sends data one bit at a time                  | Sends multiple bits simultaneously |
| Requires fewer wires                          | Requires multiple data lines       |
| Can achieve higher speeds over long distances | Faster over short distances        |
| Examples: UART, SPI, I²C, USB                 | Examples: PATA, PCI, Memory bus    |

_Serial communication uses a single data line, while parallel uses multiple lines_

### Common Serial Protocols

#### UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)

- Simple two-wire protocol (TX and RX)
- No clock signal (asynchronous)
- Both devices must agree on timing parameters (baud rate)
- Used for simple device-to-device communication

![UART Communication](../2-computers/images/pico/pico.png)
_UART uses TX (transmit) and RX (receive) lines between devices_

#### SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)

- Four-wire protocol (MOSI, MISO, SCLK, CS)
- Synchronous (uses a clock signal)
- Can have multiple slave devices with individual chip select lines
- Higher speed than UART
- Used for communicating with sensors, displays, SD cards

![SPI Communication](../2-computers/images/pico/pico.png)
_SPI allows one master to communicate with multiple slave devices_

#### I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)

- Two-wire protocol (SDA and SCL)
- Synchronous (uses a clock signal)
- Can connect multiple devices with unique addresses
- Medium speed
- Used for connecting multiple sensors and devices to a single controller

![I2C Communication](../2-computers/images/pico/pico.png)
_I²C uses a bus architecture with device addressing_

### Communication Protocol Comparison

| Protocol  | Wires        | Speed         | Multiple Devices        | Complexity | Distance   |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| UART      | 2 (TX/RX)    | Low to Medium | No (point-to-point)     | Low        | Short      |
| SPI       | 4+           | High          | Yes (multiple CS lines) | Medium     | Very Short |
| I²C       | 2 (SDA/SCL)  | Medium        | Yes (addressing)        | Medium     | Short      |
| USB       | 4            | Very High     | Yes (through hubs)      | High       | Medium     |
| Bluetooth | 0 (wireless) | Medium        | Yes (pairing)           | High       | Medium     |
| WiFi      | 0 (wireless) | Very High     | Yes (networking)        | Very High  | Long       |
