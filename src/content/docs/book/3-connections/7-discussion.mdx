   - Connected Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W using different methods

3. **Wireless Communication**:

   - Set up WiFi connections between devices
   - Implemented Bluetooth communication
   - Built web interfaces for remote monitoring and control

4. **System Integration**:

   - Created a complete IoT monitoring system
   - Combined sensors, processing, storage, and presentation
   - Applied practical communication techniques


:::note[Communication Protocol Characteristics]

**UART Communication:**
- Direct connection using TX/RX pins
- Simple to implement and debug
- Limited to short distances
- Great for device-to-device communication without network infrastructure

**WiFi Communication:**
- Enables Internet connectivity and remote access
- Higher power consumption
- Suitable for data-intensive applications
- Allows creation of web servers and IoT applications

**Bluetooth Low Energy:**
- Optimized for low power consumption
- Perfect for mobile device interactions
- Moderate range and data rates
- Ideal for sensor data and control applications

Remember that each protocol has its place in the IoT ecosystem. The best projects often combine multiple communication methods to leverage their respective strengths!

:::tip[Activity: Think about it!]

### Communication Protocols
- What are the main differences between UART, WiFi, and Bluetooth in terms of setup complexity?
- How would you decide which communication protocol to use for a battery-powered sensor network?
- When would the physical connection requirement of UART be an advantage rather than a limitation?
- How does data transmission reliability compare between wired and wireless protocols?

### Device Roles
- How do the roles of the Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W differ when implementing these communication protocols?
- What are the implications of using the Pico 2W as a server versus a client?
- How might you design a hybrid system that leverages the strengths of both devices?
- What security vulnerabilities might exist in each communication method?

### Software Implementation
- How does the coding approach differ when implementing UART, WiFi, or Bluetooth communication?
- What challenges did you encounter when implementing these protocols, and how did you overcome them?
- How would you modify the code to handle multiple clients connecting to your WiFi or Bluetooth server?
- What error handling strategies should be implemented for robust communication systems?
