## Module Summary

In this module, we've explored how to connect digital systems and work with operating systems:

1. **Operating Systems**:

   - Learned about the role of operating systems in managing hardware
   - Explored the Linux operating system on the Raspberry Pi 4B
   - Compared full OS to bare-metal programming on the Pico 2W

2. **Communication Protocols**:

   - Understood serial vs. parallel communication
   - Worked with UART, SPI, and wireless protocols
   - Connected Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W using different methods

3. **Wireless Communication**:

   - Set up WiFi connections between devices
   - Implemented Bluetooth communication
   - Built web interfaces for remote monitoring and control

4. **System Integration**:

   - Created a complete IoT monitoring system
   - Combined sensors, processing, storage, and presentation
   - Applied practical communication techniques

5. How does the approach to hardware access differ between a full operating system (like on the Raspberry Pi 4B) and bare-metal programming (like on the Pico 2W)?

6. What are the advantages and disadvantages of different communication protocols (UART, SPI, IÂ²C, WiFi, Bluetooth) for various IoT applications?

7. How might the principles of digital communication change when scaling from two devices to dozens or hundreds of devices?

8. In what ways has the Internet of Things (IoT) changed how we think about operating systems and device communication?

9. What security considerations are important when connecting multiple devices in a system?
