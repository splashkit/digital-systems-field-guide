In previous modules, we explored the fundamentals of electronics, logic gates, and computer architecture. We've worked with both the Raspberry Pi 4B as a single-board computer and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W as a microcontroller. Now, it's time to connect these worlds together and understand how different digital systems communicate with each other.

This module focuses on:

- **Operating Systems**: Understanding what they do and their role in managing hardware.
- **Communication Protocols**: Learning about serial and parallel data transmission.
- **Connecting Devices**: Practical methods for connecting Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W.
- **Wireless Communication**: Using WiFi and Bluetooth to create wireless connections.
- **Building a Connected System**: Integrating everything into a functional project.

By the end of this module, you'll understand not just individual components, but how they work together in comprehensive digital systems.
