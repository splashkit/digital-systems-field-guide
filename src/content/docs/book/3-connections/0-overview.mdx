In previous modules, we explored the fundamentals of electronics, logic gates, and computer architecture. We have worked with both the Raspberry Pi 4B as a single-board computer and the Raspberry Pi Pico 2W as a microcontroller. Now, it is time to connect these worlds together and understand how different digital systems communicate with each other.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this module you should be able to:

- Understand the functions of an operating system (OS) in managing processes, memory, and hardware interfaces of digital systems.
- Understand the fundamentals of digital system communication.
- Establish a serial connection between Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Pico and develop a Python script to send and receive data between the two devices.
- Using WiFi and Bluetooth to create wireless connections.
- Implement an interactive digital system where the Raspberry Pi sends commands to control LEDs on the Raspberry Pi Pico or vice versa. 
- Explore real-world applications of interconnected digital systems and how operating systems enable communication between hardware devices and external peripherals. 


{/*This module focuses on:

- **Operating Systems**: Understanding what they do and their role in managing hardware.
- **Communication Protocols**: Learning about serial and parallel data transmission.
- **Connecting Devices**: Practical methods for connecting Raspberry Pi 4B and Pico 2W.
- **Wireless Communication**: Using WiFi and Bluetooth to create wireless connections.
- **Building a Connected System**: Integrating everything into a functional project.

By the end of this module, you'll understand not just individual components, but how they work together in comprehensive digital systems.
